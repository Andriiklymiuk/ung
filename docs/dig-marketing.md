# Dig - Marketing Materials

## The Elon Musk Pitch

**"Most people have ideas. Very few know if they're worth pursuing."**

Dig analyzes your ideas from first principles. Not opinions. Not gut feelings. Pure logic.

You type a thought. We break it down to fundamental truths. Then we build back up with:
- Is this physically possible?
- Does this violate any laws of economics?
- Would humans actually want this?

**Result:** A clear answer in minutes, not months of wasted effort.

## Value Proposition

**For entrepreneurs and builders who have ideas but lack the team to validate them, Dig is an AI-powered idea incubator that delivers comprehensive analysis from multiple expert perspectives in minutes. Unlike expensive consultants or slow market research, Dig gives you actionable insights, execution plans, and marketing materials instantly.**

---

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"You know that app idea you've had for months? Dig tells you if it's worth building - in 10 minutes.

Type your idea, and our AI analyzes it like five experts would: First Principles breaks it down to fundamentals. A Designer evaluates the UX. Marketing finds your audience. Technical architects the solution. Finance projects the revenue.

You get a score, a recommendation (build it, pivot it, or kill it), and if it's a go - a complete execution plan with tech stack, marketing materials, and even an LLM-ready prompt to help you build.

Stop second-guessing. Start digging."

## Social Media Copy

### Twitter/X Thread

**Tweet 1:**
Just shipped "Dig" - an AI idea validator.

You type a random idea. It gives you:
- First principles analysis (Elon style)
- UX evaluation
- Market potential
- Tech architecture
- Revenue projections
- Marketing copy

10 minutes. Zero meetings. Here's how it works

**Tweet 2:**
Step 1: Type your idea

"An app that lets freelancers track time and create invoices with one click"

Dig breaks this down to first principles:
- What's fundamentally needed? (Time tracking + invoicing)
- What assumptions are we making? (Freelancers want this combined)

**Tweet 3:**
Step 2: Get 5 expert perspectives

Designer: "The one-click UX is the whole value prop. Nail that or fail."

Marketing: "Target: freelancers tired of Toggl + QuickBooks. Position as 'one tool, not two.'"

Technical: "Use local-first architecture. SQLite + Swift. No backend needed for MVP."

**Tweet 4:**
Step 3: Get the execution plan

MVP scope: Time tracker with invoice generation
Tech: Swift for macOS, Go CLI for power users
Timeline: 4 weeks to MVP

Plus: An LLM-ready prompt you can paste into Claude or GPT to help you build it.

**Tweet 5:**
Step 4: Marketing materials ready

Tagline: "Track time. Send invoices. One app."
Elevator pitch: Written.
Landing page headlines: Done.
Launch strategy: Mapped out.

All in your Dig report. Export as PDF or Markdown.

**Tweet 6:**
Why I built this:

I had 50+ app ideas. Built 3. Only 1 worked.

The problem? I couldn't tell which ones were worth my time.

Now I run every idea through Dig first. It's brutal. Honest. And it saves me months of wasted effort.

### LinkedIn Post

**How I validate ideas now (without expensive consultants)**

Last year I wasted 3 months building an app nobody wanted.

The problem wasn't the execution. It was the idea itself. I didn't validate it properly because:
- I couldn't afford market research
- I didn't have a team to debate with
- My friends just said "sounds cool"

So I built Dig.

Type any idea. Get analysis from 5 AI perspectives:

1. First Principles - Is this fundamentally sound?
2. Designer - Will users love it?
3. Marketing - Can we reach them?
4. Technical - Can we build it?
5. Financial - Will it make money?

10 minutes later: A score, a recommendation, and a full execution plan.

Now I validate before I build. My success rate went from 33% to 80%.

If you're sitting on ideas, stop guessing. Start Digging.
